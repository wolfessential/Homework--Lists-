# Homework (Lists)
Description:
For this project, you will creating a program to output a list of Presidents and the deficits incurred during their administration. The main function is provided in the project file contains two predefined lists containing the presidents name and the second list contains the deficits. We call these parallel lists as index item 0 in one list relates to index item 0 in the other list.




Having trouble with this part
The addPresident function accepts two arguments – president list and deficit list. The function does not return anything. It should first the user to enter a president’s name. If the user hits enter without entering a name, the function should return and not add to the lists. If a president’s name was entered, yet a deficit not entered, the function should return without adding to the lists. In other word, if either item is empty do not add to the lists. All input needs to be billions. Only enter one item (president and deficit) within this function and return to the main menu. New entries should be added to the end of the list. DO NOT SORT YOUR LISTS.
